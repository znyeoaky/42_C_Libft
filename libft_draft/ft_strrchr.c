char *strrchr(const char *s, int c);




/*
DESCRIPTION
	The strrchr() function is identical to strchr(), except it locates the
     last occurrence of c.

     The functions strchr() and strrchr() return a pointer to the located
     character, or NULL if the character does not appear in the string.
