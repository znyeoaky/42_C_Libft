/*
NOTE
WHY"void* have return"
	The function is declared to return a void* pointer, which is a generic pointer type that can be used to point to any data type.
DIFF"restrict vs const"
	restrict and const are both type qualifiers in C and C++, but they have different meanings and purposes.

	The const qualifier is used to indicate that a variable's value should not be modified after it has been initialized. For example, if a function takes a pointer to a const variable as an argument, it promises not to modify the value of the variable through that pointer. This can help improve code safety and readability by making it clear which variables are intended to be read-only.

	The restrict qualifier, on the other hand, is used to indicate that a pointer is the only way to access a particular region of memory.

	In short, const is used to make variables read-only, while restrict is used to optimize access to memory by specifying that a pointer is the only way to access it. 
WHY"memcpy( str1 + 11, str1, 21);(error)"
	ERROR: Source and destination overlap in memcpy(0xfff000b6b, 0xfff000b60, 21)
Points should remember before using memcpy in C:
	1.The memcpy() declares in the header file <string.h>.
	2. The size of the destination buffer must be greater than the number of bytes you want to copy.
	3. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
	4.memcpy does not check the terminating null character, so carefully use with strings.
	5.The behavior of memcpy will be undefined if you try to access the destination and source buffer beyond their length.
	6.The memcpy function does not check the validity of the destination buffer.
