char *strchr(const char *s, int c);




/*
DESCRIPTION
	The strchr() function locates the first occurrence of c (converted to a
     char) in the string pointed to by s.  The terminating null character is
     considered to be part of the string; therefore if c is `\0', the func-
     tions locate the terminating `\0'.

     The functions strchr() and strrchr() return a pointer to the located
     character, or NULL if the character does not appear in the string.
